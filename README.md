# WIKIPEDIA SNAPSHOT

A Python application that publishes a Wikipedia snapshot for your search term to Skynet and gets a skylink to share.

**Let's build a free internet**.


## Setup
You must install the following packages:
- siaskynet
- PyInputPlus
- wikipedia


## Usage
In your terminal run the following command:
`python3 wiki-snapshot.py`

Once you input a search term, the application generates a text file which will be saved locally.
And more important it will be published to Skynet with a skylink that you can share with everyone.
